#: As a <role>, I want <goal/desire> [so that <benefit>]
US1: As a user, I want to load RAW files directly so that I do not have to preprocess them.
US2: As a user, I want the software to align my images with the MTB algorithm.
US3: As a user, I want to be able to save the result in PFS or Tiff LogLuv32 formats.
    In the Tiff case, the metadata of the source images must be transferred, using either the wider apperture or the longer exposure time. Other metadata is supposed to be the same in all the source images.
US4: As a user, I want the software to detect the output format based on the file extension.
US5: As a user, I want the software to merge the exposures BEFORE the demosaicing, so that the information suffers as less transformations as possible.
