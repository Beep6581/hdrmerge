#: As a <role>, I want <goal/desire> [so that <benefit>]. PR priority (1 highest)
US22 As a user, I want a batch mode to detect sets of exposures and produce an output negative for each one. PR4
US25 As a user, I want to be able to run HDRMerge on Windows. PR2
US26 As a user, I want to be able to run HDRMerge on Mac OS. PR2

Doing:
US24 As a user, I want to save/load the image index to/from file, so that I can continue editing it in a later session. PR2

Done:
US1: As a user, I want to load RAW files directly. PR1
    The loader also subtracts the black point and computes the logarithmic exposure.
US2: As a user, I want the software to align my images using the MTB algorithm on RAW space. PR1
US11: As a user, I want the software to automatically compute the relative exposure between adjancent images. PR1
US12 As a user, I want to see a representation of the result. PR1
    The representation will be done in greyscale.
US14 As a user, I want to be able to add and remove pixels from each image. PR2
    US14-1 Use a different color to shade each image pixels. PR2
    US14-2 Use a button set to select the image we are editing. PR2
    US14-3 To avoid problems at the edges, new pixels can only be added on top of the next image pixels, and deleted from not obscured zones. PR3
    US14-4 Add undo functionality. PR4
US15 As a user, I want shortcuts to the most common operations: move, add and remove. PR2
US16 As a user, I want to be able to save the raw result as DNG with 32-bit floating point sample format. PR1
	Take other parameters from one of the images.
US17 As a user, I want the loaded pictures automatically rotated. PR1
US18 As a user, I want to be able to load any kind of raw files. PR1
US19 As a developer, I want to add a progress indicator to long operations, like load and save. PR1
US20 As a user, I want the grab tool to work as a in Gwenview, without actually moving the mouse pointer. PR2
US21 As a developer, I want to update the GUI texts and translations. PR1
US23 As a user, I want a redo functionality in the deghosting tools. PR2
