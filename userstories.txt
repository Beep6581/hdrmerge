#: As a <role>, I want <goal/desire> [so that <benefit>]. PR priority (1 highest)
US3: As a user, I want to be able to save the result in PFS or Tiff LogLuv32 formats. PR1
    In the Tiff case, the metadata of the source images must be transferred, using either the wider apperture or the longer exposure time. Other metadata is supposed to be the same in all the source images.
US4: As a user, I want the software to detect the output format based on the file extension. PR2
US5: As a user, I want to apply a custom white balance to the final image. PR3
    Choose among camera, average, zone.
US6: As a user, I want to apply a noise reduction algorithm to the final image. PR4
US7: As a user, I want to correct the chromatic aberrations. PR4
US8: As a user, I want to transform the colorspace to an apropriate one. PR4
US9: As a user, I want to correct color artifacts after demosaicing. PR4
US10: As a user, I want to demosaic the image with the AMAzE algorithm. PR1
US12 As a user, I want to see a representation of the result. PR1
	The representation will be done in greyscale.
US13 As a user, I want to see the representation in color. PR5
US14 As a user, I want to be able to add and remove pixels from each image. PR2
	The software must be able to highlight the pixels of a certain image, like shading the pixels that are not selected from that image. Other possibilities might be interesting.

Done:
US1: As a user, I want to load RAW files directly. PR1
    The loader also subtracts the black point and computes the logarithmic exposure.
US2: As a user, I want the software to align my images using the MTB algorithm on RAW space. PR1
US11: As a user, I want the software to automatically compute the relative exposure between adjancent images. PR1
