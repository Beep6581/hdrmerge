US14 As a user, I want to be able to add and remove pixels from each image. PR2
    The software must be able to highlight the pixels of a certain image, like shading the pixels that are not selected from that image. Other possibilities might be interesting.
US15 As a user, I want shortcuts to the most common operations: move, add and remove.

Done:
US1: As a user, I want to load RAW files directly. PR1
    The loader also subtracts the black point and computes the logarithmic exposure.
US2: As a user, I want the software to align my images using the MTB algorithm on RAW space. PR1
US11: As a user, I want the software to automatically compute the relative exposure between adjancent images. PR1
US12 As a user, I want to see a representation of the result. PR1
    The representation will be done in greyscale.
US16 As a user, I want to be able to save the raw result as DNG with 32-bit floating point sample format. PR1
	Take other parameters from one of the images.
