Installation:

HDRMerge is developed with Qt, libTiff, libpfs and CMake. OpenEXR is
also planned to be supported in the future as an output format. You
will need the development files of these libraries, and CMake version
2.6 or greater.

In brief, the steps to compile and install HDRMerge are:

$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
$ sudo make install

You will probably need root access to install HDRMerge to its default
location, in /usr/local/bin
