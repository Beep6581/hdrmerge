Installation:

HDRMerge is developed with Qt, LibRaw, Exiv2, DNG & XMP SDK and CMake. You
will need the development files of these libraries, and CMake version 2.6
or greater.

In brief, the steps to compile and install HDRMerge are:

$ mkdir build
$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=you_choose
$ (sudo) make install

You will probably need root access to install HDRMerge to its default
location, in /usr/local/bin



Usage:

HDRMerge is an exposure merging tool, with a surprise: it merges raw images in
raw space and generates a high dynamic range DNG file. It uses version 1.4 of
the DNG format, which allows encoding data with 32bit floats. Note that HDRMerge
DOES NOT tone map the HDR result. You must load the result into a raw developer
that understands DNG v1.4 format (a patch for Rawtherapee is provided).
HDRMerge is a free implementation of the concepts presented by Guillermo Luijk
in its program Zero Noise [2]. His tutorial on the internals of Zero Noise is
very useful to understand HDRMerge. HDRMerge currently only runs on Linux.

Source exposures can be loaded from the Open option in the File menu, or just
passed as arguments in the command line. They must be made with the same camera.

Once the source exposures are loaded, the interface presents you with a
preview of the result, and some tools to tune it. The default tool is pan.
You can pan the preview by dragging it with the left mouse button.

There are two more tools in the lower left corner. These tools add or remove
pixels from the current exposure ignoring its threshold. Their purpose is to
remove "ghosts" from the result. That is, objects that appear only in some of
the source exposures.

Once the preview is satisfactory, the Save HDR option of the File menu
generates the DNG file.
